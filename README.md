# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This app is meant to be a flashcard making and practicing app. It's pretty simple and has two main pages - one that shows the list of flashcard sets, and the other shows the flashcards in the sets. It currently has features to make and delete flash card sets, make and delete flash cards, and check off learned flash cards.  

This is a very basic app that I put together in order to gain a little experience with Swift. I would love to be fluent so I want to continue developing this app and others to continue to get experience.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
