# Overview

This app is meant to be a flashcard making and practicing app. It's pretty simple and has two main pages - one that shows the list of flashcard sets, and the other shows the flashcards in the sets. It currently has features to make and delete flash card sets, make and delete flash cards, and check off learned flash cards. 

This is a very basic app that I put together in order to gain a little experience with Swift. I would love to be fluent so I want to continue developing this app and others to continue to get experience. I would love to know enough to write my own apps to fill needs in mine and other's lives.

# Development Environment

I bought a Mac for this project! I don't think I had to but it made it way more exciting!
I used Xcode as a development environment, and I used ChatGPT to bounce ideas off of and get coding advice.

Everything is written in Swift. I used an older backend called CoreData instead of their newer one because I found more help online with that.

# Future Work

* UI/UX improvements - currently very clunky. Features work but it desperately needs help.
* Make it work better across both MacOS and iOS. Currently there is code that breaks on MacOS but works on iOS.
* Expand capabilities to allow clean reviewing of the flashcards. 
    * This was included in the original project description but proved too much for a single sprint.
